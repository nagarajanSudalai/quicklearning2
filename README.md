# QuickStep

Grade-wise puzzles and games for children in Grades 1–5. One codebase, three parts:

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `apps/web` | Marketing homepage (React + Vite) |
| `apps/mobile` | The app — Expo / React Native for iOS, Android and web |
| `packages/content` | Shared puzzle bank (JSON), curriculum, puzzle types and design tokens |

See [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) for the phase plan. **Current status: Phase 1 — Grade 1 Maths.**

## Getting started

```bash
npm install                 # once, at the repo root (npm workspaces)

npm run mobile              # Expo dev server — press w for web, or scan the QR code with Expo Go
npm run web                 # homepage dev server
npm run validate-content    # check every puzzle in packages/content/puzzles
npm run typecheck
```

## Grade 1 Maths (Phase 1)

Six topics, 20 puzzles each across 3 levels — 120 puzzles:

| Topic | Puzzle type | Levels |
|---|---|---|
| Counting | `count-objects` | 1–5 · 6–10 · 11–20 |
| Adding | `arithmetic` | sums to 5 with pictures · to 10 with pictures · to 10, numbers only |
| Taking away | `arithmetic` | within 5 · within 10 · numbers only |
| Shapes | `shape-match` | circle/square/triangle · + star/diamond · square vs rectangle |
| More or fewer | `compare` | big gap · gap of 2 · gap of 1 |
| Patterns | `pattern` | AB · AAB/ABB · ABC/ABBC |

How play works: a session is 10 puzzles, unsolved ones first and easiest first. Each question is read aloud (with a 🔊 button to repeat it). A wrong pick wiggles and the child can try again. A star is earned only for a right answer on the first try. Stars, solved puzzles and the daily streak are saved on the device. Parent settings (progress, sound, change grade, reset) are behind a multiplication-question parent gate.

## Adding content

Puzzles are data, not code. Each record in `packages/content/puzzles/**.json` looks like:

```json
{ "id": "g1-addition-03", "grade": 1, "subject": "maths", "topic": "g1-addition", "difficulty": 1,
  "prompt": "What is 2 plus 1?", "type": "arithmetic",
  "payload": { "a": 2, "op": "+", "b": 1, "item": "🎈" }, "options": [1, 3, 4], "answer": 3 }
```

- Edit or add records by hand, then run `npm run validate-content`. It checks ids are unique, the answer is one of the options, and the answer is actually correct (the sum adds up, the count matches, the pattern continues).
- `packages/content/scripts/generate-g1-maths.ts` made the first Grade 1 bank. Running it again **overwrites** `puzzles/g1-maths/`.
- New puzzle type: add it to `src/types.ts` and the validator, then add one renderer entry in `apps/mobile/src/components/puzzles/renderers.tsx`.
- New topic: add it to `TOPICS` in `src/curriculum.ts` and import its JSON in `src/index.ts`. Unlock a subject or grade in `AVAILABLE`.
